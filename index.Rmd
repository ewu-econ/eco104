Assalamualaikum Students! ðŸ‘‹ 

A warm welcome to all of you to the course **ECO 104 â€“ Statistics for Business and Econmics - I, Sections 7 & 9 (Summer 2025)**. This is the first course in a sequence of two Statistics courses that you will be taking as part of your undergraduate program in Business and Economics. ðŸ“š 

In this course our primary goal is to focus on two key areas: **Descriptive Statistics** and **Probability Theory**. 

We will start with the **Descriptive Statistics** part. Here youâ€™ll learn how to present raw data clearly through visual tools such as **bar charts, histograms, box-plots, and scatter-plots** ðŸ“Š, and then through numerical measures including the **sample mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and quantiles**. The goal is to help you recognise patterns, spot outliers, and summarise a dataset with clarity. 

From description we move to **Probability Theory** part, which is the formal **language of uncertainty**. ðŸŽ² We will define **what is probability**, learn **probability rules**, introduce **random variables** and their **probability distributions**, and explore core parametric distribution models such as the **Binomial, Poisson, and Normal**. Concepts like **Expectation and Variance** will give you a precise way to quantify risk and variability in real-world situations.

A quick heads-up: **PLEASE, and PLEASE again ... show up to every class.** This summer term is short, and each session builds on the previous one, so **missing even a single class can make your life very difficult later**.

Weâ€™re **Tanvir Hossain** (your instructor) and **Habiba Afroz** (the TA for this course) from the [Economics Department at East West University](https://fbe.ewubd.edu/economics-department). Reach out anytime to us via Discord DM, Google Classroom, or office hoursâ€”if you need help or just want to talk about Statistics. Thanks again, letâ€™s have a great term together!

You will get the course outline in PDF soon.... please check the webpage frequently for updates.
